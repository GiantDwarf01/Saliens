# What is this?

This is a fork of xpaw's SalienCheat autoplay script. This script works identically, except it'll prioritize time on planets with games you specify. Otherwise, it'll work as normal and look for the best XP options.

## How to Specify Games
1) Create a file called 'preferredGames.txt' in your PHP directory
2) Find the app ids of the game(s) you want to prioritize - I'd suggest using a site like https://wtzb.github.io/SalienProgress/ to see the options
3) In your preferredGames.txt, paste the app ID's in, one ID per line
